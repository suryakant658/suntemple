        >Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark
        about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast from Puri city on the coastline in
        Puri district, Odisha, India.[1][2] The temple is attributed to king
        Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE.[3][4]
        Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex
        has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels
        and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high,[1][5]
        much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara
        tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the
        mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are
        famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including
        erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a
        classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga
        architecture.[1][6] The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is
        unclear and still remains a source of controversy.[7] Theories range
        from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the
        course of being sacked several times by Muslim armies between the 15th
        and 17th centuries.[1][7] This temple was called the "Black Pagoda" in
        European sailor accounts as early as 1676 because it looked like a great
        tiered tower which appeared black.[6][8] Similarly, the Jagannath Temple
        in Puri was called the "White Pagoda". Both temples served as important
        landmarks for sailors in the Bay of Bengal.[9][10] The temple that
        exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of
        British India-era archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site in 1984,[1][2] it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who
        gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of
        February.[6] Konark Sun Temple is depicted on the reverse side of the
        Indian currency note of 10 rupees to signify its importance to Indian
        cultural heritage.[11] Temple is located in an eponymous village (now
        NAC Area) about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast of Puri and 65
        kilometres (40 mi) southeast of Bhubaneswar on the Bay of Bengal
        coastline in the Indian state of Odisha. The nearest airport is Biju
        Patnaik Airport in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. Both Puri and Bhubaneswar are
        major railway hubs connected by Indian Railways. The Konark Sun Temple
        was built in 1250 CE during the reign of the Eastern Ganga King
        Narsimhadeva-1 from stone in the form of a giant ornamented chariot
        dedicated to the Sun god, Surya. In Hindu Vedic iconography Surya is
        represented as rising in the east and traveling rapidly across the sky
        in a chariot drawn by seven horses. He is described typically as a
        resplendent standing person holding a lotus flower in both his hands,
        riding the chariot marshaled by the charioteer Aruna.[13][14] The seven
        horses are named after the seven meters of Sanskrit prosody: Gayatri,
        Brihati, Ushnih, Jagati, Trishtubha, Anushtubha, and Pankti.[14]
        Typically seen flanking Surya are two females who represent the dawn
        goddesses, Usha and Pratyusha. The goddesses are shown to be shooting
        arrows, a symbol of their initiative in challenging the darkness.[15]
        The architecture is also symbolic, with the chariot's twelve pairs of
        wheels corresponding to the 12 months of the Hindu calendar, each month
        paired into two cycles (Shukla and Krishna).[16] The Konark temple
        presents this iconography on a grand scale. It has 24 elaborately carved
        stone wheels which are nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter and are pulled
        by a set of seven horses.[5][2][17] When viewed from inland during the
        dawn and sunrise, the chariot-shaped temple appears to emerge from the
        depths of the blue sea carrying the sun.[18] The main temple at Konark,
        locally called the deul, no longer exists. It was surrounded by
        subsidiary shrines containing niches depicting Hindu deities,
        particularly Surya in many of his aspects. The deul was built on a high
        terrace.[5] The temple was originally a complex consisting of the main
        sanctuary, called the rekha deul, or bada deul (lit. big sanctum).[18]
        In front of it was the bhadra deul (lit. small sanctum), or jagamohana
        (lit. assembly hall of the people) (called a mandapa in other parts of
        India.[20]). The attached platform was called the pida deul, which
        consisted of a square mandapa with a pyramidal roof.[18] All of these
        structures were square at their core, and each was overlain with the
        pancharatha plan containing a variegated exterior.[18] The central
        projection, called the raha, is more pronounced than the side
        projections, called kanika-paga, a style that aims for an interplay of
        sunlight and shade and adds to the visual appeal of the structure
        throughout the day. The design manual for this style is found in the
        Silpa Sastra of ancient Odisha.[18][21]
